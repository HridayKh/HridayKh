# 👋 Hi, I’m Hriday Khanna

Backend-focused **Java developer** based in Punjab, India.  
Currently in Class 11, learning by building and operating real systems.

I care about correctness, system behavior over time, and understanding how backend frameworks actually work.

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Java backend development (Servlets, Quarkus)
- Long-running services & bots
- Observability: structured logging & error tracking
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions and self-hosted runners
